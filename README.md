# Face Detection Using OpenCV 
<img src="icon.png" align="right" />

In this beginnerâ€™s project, we will learn how to implement real-time human face recognition. We will build this project in Python using OpenCV. We will study the Haar Cascade Classifier algorithms in OpenCV. Haar Cascade Classifier is a popular algorithm for object detection.

A small demo of the mini-project:

## Cascade Classifiers and Haar Features

Object Detection using Haar feature-based cascade classifiers is an effective object detection method proposed by Paul Viola and Michael Jones in their paper, "Rapid Object Detection using a Boosted Cascade of Simple Features" in 2001. It is a machine learning based approach where a cascade function is trained from a lot of positive and negative images. It is then used to detect objects in other images.
