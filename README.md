<img src="icon.png" align="right" />

In this beginnerâ€™s project, we will learn how to implement real-time human face recognition. We will build this project in Python using OpenCV. We will study the Haar Cascade Classifier algorithms in OpenCV. Haar Cascade Classifier is a popular algorithm for object detection.
